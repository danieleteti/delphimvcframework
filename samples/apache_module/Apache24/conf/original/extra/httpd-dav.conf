# Distributed authoring and versioning (WebDAV)

# Required modules: mod_alias, mod_auth_digest, mod_authn_core, mod_authn_file,
#                   mod_authz_core, mod_authz_user, mod_dav, mod_dav_fs,
#                   mod_setenvif

# The following example gives DAV write access to a directory called
# "uploads" under the ServerRoot directory.
#
# The User/Group specified in httpd.conf needs to have write permissions
# on the directory where the DavLockDB is placed and on any directory where
# "Dav On" is specified.

DavLockDB "c:/Apache24/var/DavLock"

Alias /uploads "c:/Apache24/uploads"

<Directory "c:/Apache24/uploads">
    Dav On

    AuthType Digest
    AuthName DAV-upload
    # You can use the htdigest program to create the password database:
    #   htdigest -c "c:/Apache24/user.passwd" DAV-upload admin
    AuthUserFile "c:/Apache24/user.passwd"
    AuthDigestProvider file

    # Allow universal read-access, but writes are restricted
    # to the admin user.
    <RequireAny>
        Require method GET POST OPTIONS
        Require user admin
    </RequireAny>
</Directory>

#
# The following directives disable redirects on non-GET requests for
# a directory that does not include the trailing slash.  This fixes a 
# problem with several clients that do not appropriately handle 
# redirects for folders with DAV methods.
