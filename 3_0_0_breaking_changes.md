# 3.0.0 breaking changes

- ```RenderListAsProperty<T>``` has been removed from TMVCController. You can set such kind of specialized serializations in your custom base controller.
- ```RenderJSONArrayAsProperty``` has been removed from TMVCController. You can set such kind of specialized serializations in your custom base controller.
- ```Render``` has been removed from TMVCController (was deprecated).
- ```Render(TJSONValue)``` has been removed from TMVCController (use Render(TObject)).
- Trying to deserialize a ```TJSONNull``` the target instance will not be freed anymore (consistency with serialize).
- ```Context.Request.BodyAsJSONObject``` dosen't exist any more. Use BodyAs<T> or the following pattern to migrate:
```
JSON := TJSONObject.ParseJSONValue(Context.Request.Body) as TJSONObject;
try
   if not Assigned(JSON) then
      raise EMVCException.Create('Invalid JSON');
   // do something here
finally
  JSON.Free;
end;
```
- ```TMVCConfigKey``` moved to unit ```MVCFramework.Commons```.
- ```TMVCMimeType``` was renamed to ```TMVCMediaType```.
- ```TMVCController.Render;``` no parameter method do not exist anymore. If the return is a ResponseStream, use the ```RenderResponseStream;```. 
- ```TMVCController.PushJSONToView;``` was renamed to ```PushToView```and Removed SystemJSON dependency, use the ToJSON method if necessary.
- There is no more a default view engine for Server Side Views (before 3.0 there was mustache).
- Mustache engine is no more the only view engine available. Now you can implement all the view engines you need (check the serversideviewsprimer).
- On Linux there is no built-in available view engine available. In other words, using only the built-in classes, you cannot use server side views on linux (dmustache is not compatible on linux).
- HTTP File Upload doesn't work on Linux because of a bug in Delphi 10.2 (https://quality.embarcadero.com/browse/RSP-17216).
- ```[MapperJSONNaming(TJSONNameCase.JSONNameLowerCase)]``` now must be changed in ```[MVCNameCase(ncLowerCase)]```
- ```[MapperJSONNaming(TJSONNameCase.JSONNameUpperCase)]``` now must be changed in ```[MVCNameCase(ncUpperCase)]```

## TRESTClient
Every reference to TJSON* has been removed from the TRESTClient public interface. To port the existing code, you have to include ```MVCFramework.RESTClient.SystemJSONUtils``` and change your code as following:

Before
    ```lMyJSONObject := Response.BodyAsJsonObject.Clone as TJSONObject;```
After	
	```delphi
	lMyJSONObject := TSystemJSON.BodyAsJsonObject(Response) as TJSONObject;
	try
	  //use the object
	finally
	  lMyJSONObject.Free;
	end;
	```

The memory allocated for the TJSONValue descendant (e.g. TJSONObject, TJSONArray and so on) *is no more managed by the TRESTClient itself* but must be feed by the calling code.	

- DelphiStompClient has been removed from the core. The following method is no more available in TMVCController.
  ```delphi
	function GetNewStompClient(const AClientId: string = ''): IStompClient;
	```
	
- ```TMVCConfigKey.ISAPIPath``` has been substituted with ```TMVCConfigKey.PathPrefix``` and now is applicated to all kind of projects (not only ISAPI);
- ```MapperSerializeAsString``` attribute is now ```MVCSerializeAsString```
- ```ContentCharset``` is no more available (everywhere). You have to properly set ContentType. To do that is available the function ```CreateContentType```.
