## How to install DMVCFramework
*It is not needed to download the git repository*. Just download the [latest version as a zip file](https://github.com/danieleteti/delphimvcframework/releases/latest) and you are ok.
If you want to participate to the testing phase (which usually contains brand new features) you can get the [latest Release Candidate version](https://github.com/danieleteti/delphimvcframework/releases).
Take in mind that, even if RCs are usually very stable, they are still not ready for production utilization.

```delphi
//Now is really easy to add "_links" property automatically for each collection element while rendering
Render<TPerson>(People, True,
    procedure(const APerson: TPerson; const Links: IMVCLinks)
    begin
      Links.AddRefLink
        .Add(HATEOAS.HREF, '/people/' + APerson.ID.ToString)
        .Add(HATEOAS.REL, 'self')
        .Add(HATEOAS._TYPE, 'application/json')
        .Add('title', 'Details for ' + APerson.FullName);
      Links.AddRefLink
        .Add(HATEOAS.HREF, '/people')
        .Add(HATEOAS.REL, 'people')
        .Add(HATEOAS._TYPE, 'application/json');
    end);

		
//Datasets have a similar anon method to do the same thing
Render(lDM.qryCustomers, False,
  procedure(const DS: TDataset; const Links: IMVCLinks)
  begin
	Links.AddRefLink
	  .Add(HATEOAS.HREF, '/customers/' + DS.FieldByName('cust_no').AsString)
	  .Add(HATEOAS.REL, 'self')
	  .Add(HATEOAS._TYPE, 'application/json');
	Links.AddRefLink
	  .Add(HATEOAS.HREF, '/customers/' + DS.FieldByName('cust_no').AsString + '/orders')
	  .Add(HATEOAS.REL, 'orders')
	  .Add(HATEOAS._TYPE, 'application/json');
  end);

//Single object rendering allows HATEOAS too!
Render(lPerson, False,
  procedure(const AObject: TObject; const Links: IMVCLinks)
  begin
	Links.AddRefLink
	  .Add(HATEOAS.HREF, '/people/' + TPerson(AObject).ID.ToString)
	  .Add(HATEOAS.REL, 'self')
	  .Add(HATEOAS._TYPE, TMVCMediaType.APPLICATION_JSON);
	Links.AddRefLink
	  .Add(HATEOAS.HREF, '/people')
	  .Add(HATEOAS.REL, 'people')
	  .Add(HATEOAS._TYPE, TMVCMediaType.APPLICATION_JSON);
  end);
	
```

- Better packages organization (check `packages` folder)
- New! `TMVCActiveRecord.Count` method (e.g. `TMVCActiveRecord.Count(TCustomer)` returns the number of records for the entity mapped by the class `TCustomer`)
- Change! `TMVCACtiveRecord.GetByPK<T>` raises an exception by default if the record is not found - optionally can returns `nil` using new parameter `RaiseExceptionIfNotFound` 
- New! `contains` clause has been added in the RQL compiler for Firebird and Interbase
- New! `TMVCAnalyticsMiddleware` to do automatic analytics on the API (generates a CSV file). Based on an idea by Nirav Kaku (https://www.facebook.com/nirav.kaku). Check the sample in `\samples\middleware_analytics\`
- New! `TMVCActiveRecord.DeleteAll` deletes all the records from a table
- New! `TMVCActiveRecord.DeleteRQL` deletes records using an `RQL` expression as `where` clause.
- New! `TMVCActiveRecord.Store` which automatically executes Insert or Update considering primary key value.
- New! `TMVCActiveRecord` allows to use table name and field name with spaces (currently supported only by the PostgreSQL compiler). 
- New! Microsoft SQLServer Support in `MVCActiveRecord` and RQL (*thanks to one of the biggest Delphi based company in Italy which heavily uses DMVCFramework* and *[DMSContainer](http://www.bittimeprofessionals.it/prodotti/dmscontainer)*)
- New! SQLite support in `MVCActiveRecord` and RQL, so that `MVCActiveRecord` can be used also for Delphi mobile projects!
- Default JSON Serializer can verbatim pass properties with type `JsonDataObjects.TJSONObject` without  using `string` as carrier of JSON
- Improved! `ActiveRecordShowCase` sample is much better now.
- Improved! All `ActiveRecord` methods which retrieve records can now specify the data type of each parameter (using Delphi's `TFieldType` enumeration).
- Improved! In case of unhandled exception `TMVCEngine` is compliant with the default response content-type (usually it did would reply using `text/plain`).
- Added! New overloads for all the Log\* calls. Now it is possible to call `LogD(lMyObject)` to get logged `lMyObject` as JSON (custom type serializers not supported in log).
- New! `StrDict(array of string, array of string)` function allows to render a dictionary of strings in a really simple way. See the following action sample.
```delphi
procedure TMy.GetPeople(const Value: Integer);
begin
  if Value mod 2 <> 0 then
  begin
    raise EMVCException.Create(HTTP_STATUS.NotAcceptable, 'We don''t like odd numbers');
  end;
  Render(
    StrDict(
      ['id', 'message'],
      ['123', 'We like even numbers, thank you for your ' + Value.ToString]
    ));
end;
```
- New! Custom Exception Handling (Based on work of [David Moorhouse](https://github.com/fastbike)). Sample "custom_exception_handling" show how to use it.

- Improved! Exceptions rendering while using MIME types different to `application/json`.

- Improved! JSONRPC Automatic Object Publishing can not invoke inherited methods if not explicitly defined with `MVCInheritable` attribute.

- New! JSONRPC Hooks for published objects

  ```delphi
  //Called before as soon as the HTTP arrives
  procedure TMyPublishedObject.OnBeforeRouting(const JSON: TJDOJsonObject);
  
  //Called before the invoked method
  procedure TMyPublishedObject.OnBeforeCall(const JSONRequest: TJDOJsonObject);
  
  //Called just before to send response to the client
  procedure TMyPublishedObject.OnBeforeSendResponse(const JSONResponse: TJDOJsonObject);
  
  ```

  

- SSL Server support for `TMVCListener` (Thanks to [Sven Harazim](https://github.com/landrix))

- Improved! Datasets serialization speed improvement. In some case the performance [improves of 2 order of magnitude](https://github.com/danieleteti/delphimvcframework/issues/205#issuecomment-479513158). (Thanks to https://github.com/pedrooliveira01)

- New! Added `in` operator in RQL parser (Thank you to [João Antônio Duarte](https://github.com/joaoduarte19) for his initial work on this)

- New! Added `TMVCActiveRecord.Count<T>(RQL)` to count record based on RQL criteria

- New! `TMVCActiveRecord` can handle non  autogenerated primary key.

- New! Calling `<jsonrpcendpoint>/describe` returns the methods list available for that endpoint.

- New! Experimental (alpha stage) support for Android servers!

- New! Added support for `X-HTTP-Method-Override` to work behind corporate firewalls.

- New Sample! Server in DLL

- Added new method in the dataset helper to load data into a dataset from a specific JSONArray property of a JSONObject   `procedure TDataSetHelper.LoadJSONArrayFromJSONObjectProperty(const AJSONObjectString: string; const aPropertyName: String);` 

- Improved! New constants defined in `HTTP_STATUS` to better describe the http status response.

- Improved! Now Firebird RQL' SQLGenerator can include primary key in `CreateInsert` if not autogenerated.

- New! Added support for `TArray<String>`, `TArray<Integer>` and `TArray<Double>` in default JSON serializer (Thank you [Pedro Oliveira](https://github.com/pedrooliveira01))

- Improved JWT Standard Compliance! Thanks to [Vinicius Sanchez](https://github.com/viniciussanchez) for his work on [issue #241](https://github.com/danieleteti/delphimvcframework/issues/241)

- Improved! DMVCFramework now has 130+ unit tests that checks its functionalities at each build!

- New! `StrToJSONObject` function to safely parse a string into a JSON object.

- New! Serialization callback for custom `TDataSet` descendants serialization in `TMVCJsonDataObjectsSerializer`.
```delphi
procedure TMainForm.btnDataSetToJSONArrayClick(Sender: TObject);
var
  lSer: TMVCJsonDataObjectsSerializer;
  lJArray: TJSONArray;
begin
  FDQuery1.Open();
  lSer := TMVCJsonDataObjectsSerializer.Create;
  try
    lJArray := TJSONArray.Create;
    try
      lSer.DataSetToJsonArray(FDQuery1, lJArray, TMVCNameCase.ncLowerCase, [],
        procedure(const aField: TField; const aJsonObject: TJSONObject; var Handled: Boolean)
        begin
          if SameText(aField.FieldName, 'created_at') then
          begin
            aJsonObject.S['year_and_month'] := FormatDateTime('yyyy-mm', TDateTimeField(aField).Value);
            Handled := True;
          end;
        end);
	  //The json objects will not contains "created_at" anymore, but only "year_and_month".
      Memo1.Lines.Text := lJArray.ToJSON(false);
    finally
      lJArray.Free;
    end;
  finally
    lSer.Free;
  end;
end;
```
- New! Shortcut render' methods which simplify RESTful API development
    - `procedure Render201Created(const Location: String = ''; const Reason: String = 'Created'); virtual;`
    - `    procedure Render202Accepted(const HREF: String; const ID: String; const Reason: String = 'Accepted'); virtual;`
    - `procedure Render204NoContent(const Reason: String = 'No Content'); virtual;`
    
- Added de/serializing iterables (e.g. generic lists) support without `MVCListOf` attribute (Thank you to [João Antônio Duarte](https://github.com/joaoduarte19)).

    It is now possible to deserialize a generic class like this:

    ```delphi
      TGenericEntity<T: class> = class
      private
        FCode: Integer;
        FItems: TObjectList<T>;
        FDescription: string;
      public
        constructor Create;
        destructor Destroy; override;
        property Code: Integer read FCode write FCode;
        property Description: string read FDescription write FDescription;
        // MVCListOf(T) <- No need
        property Items: TObjectList<T> read FItems write FItems;
      end;
    ```

    Before it was not possible because you should add the `MVCListOf` attribute to the `TObjectList` type property.

- New! The **MVCAREntitiesGenerator** can optionally register all the generated entities also in the `ActiveRecordMappingRegistry` (Thanks to [Fabrizio Bitti](https://twitter.com/fabriziobitti) from [bit Time Software](http://www.bittime.it))

- **Breaking Change!** Middleware `OnAfterControllerAction` are now invoked in the same order of `OnBeforeControllerAction` (previously were invoked in reversed order).

- **Breaking Change!** `TDataSetHolder` doesn't renders dataset in a property called `items` but in a property named `data` (to be more standard).

- Fixed! Has been patched a serious security bug affecting deployment configurations which uses internal WebServer to serve static files (do not affect all Apache, IIS or proxied deployments).  Thanks to **Stephan Munz** to have discovered it. *Update to dmvcframework-3.2-RC5+ is required for all such kind of deployments.*

- Added ability to serialize/deserialize types enumerated by an array of mapped values (Thanks to [João Antônio Duarte](https://github.com/joaoduarte19))

    ```delphi
    type
      TMonthEnum = (meJanuary, meFebruary, meMarch, meApril);
    
      TEntityWithEnums = class
      private
        FMonthMappedNames: TMonthEnum;
        FMonthEnumName: TMonthEnum;    
        FMonthOrder: TMonthEnum;    
      public
        // List items separated by comma or semicolon
        [MVCEnumSerializationType(estEnumMappedValues,
        	'January,February,March,April')]
        property MonthMappedNames: TMonthEnum 
        	read FMonthMappedNames write FMonthMappedNames;
        [MVCEnumSerializationType(estEnumName)]
        property MonthEnumName: TMonthEnum 
        	read FMonthEnumName write FMonthEnumName;
        [MVCEnumSerializationType(estEnumOrd)]
        property MonthOrder: TMonthEnum read FMonthOrder write FMonthOrder;
      end;
    ...
    ```

  - FIX to the mapper about the datasets null values (needs to be checked in old Delphi versions)
  - ADDED support for Boolean values in datasets serialization
  - ADDED unit tests about Mapper and dataset fields nullability
  - The current version is available in constant ```DMVCFRAMEWORK_VERSION``` defined in ```MVCFramework.Commons.pas```

## Samples and documentation
DMVCFramework is provided with a lot of examples focused on specific functionality.
All samples are in [Samples](samples) folder.
Check the [DMVCFramework Developer Guide](https://danieleteti.gitbooks.io/delphimvcframework/content/) (work in progress).


# Getting Started
Below the is a basic sample of a DMVCFramework server wich can be deployed as standa-alone application, as an Apache module or as ISAPI dll. This flexibility is provided by the Delphi WebBroker framework (built-in in Delphi since Delphi 4).
The project contains an IDE Expert which make creating DMVCFramework project a breeze. However not all the Delphi version are supported, so here's the manual version (which is not complicated at all).

To create this server, you have to create a new ```Delphi Projects -> WebBroker -> WebServerApplication```. Then add the following changes to the webmodule.
```delphi
unit WebModuleUnit1;

interface

uses System.SysUtils, System.Classes, Web.HTTPApp, MVCFramework {this unit contains TMVCEngine class};

type
  TWebModule1 = class(TWebModule)
    procedure WebModuleCreate(Sender: TObject);
    procedure WebModuleDestroy(Sender: TObject);

  private
    MVC: TMVCEngine;

  public
    { Public declarations }
  end;

var
  WebModuleClass: TComponentClass = TWebModule1;

implementation

{$R *.dfm}

uses UsersControllerU; //this is the unit where is defined the controller

procedure TWebModule1.WebModuleCreate(Sender: TObject);
begin
  MVC := TMVCEngine.Create(Self);
  MVC.Config[TMVCConfigKey.DocumentRoot] := 'public_html'; //if you need some static html, javascript, etc (optional)
  MVC.AddController(TUsersController); //see next section to know how to create a controller
end;

procedure TWebModule1.WebModuleDestroy(Sender: TObject);
begin
  MVC.Free;
end;

end.
```

That's it! You have just created your first DelphiMVCFramework. Now you have to add a controller to respond to the http request.

## Sample Controller
Below a basic sample of a DMVCFramework controller with 2 action

```delphi
unit UsersControllerU;
  
interface
  
uses 
  MVCFramework;
 
type 
   [MVCPath('/users')]
   TUsersController = class(TMVCController)
   public

    //The following action will be with a GET request like the following
    //http://myserver.com/users/3
    [MVCPath('/($id)')]
    [MVCProduces('application/json')]
    [MVCHTTPMethod([httpGET])]
    [MVCDoc('Returns a user as a JSON object')]
    procedure GetUser(id: Integer);

    
    //The following action will be with a GET request like the following
    //http://myserver.com/users
    [MVCPath('/')]
    [MVCProduces('application/json')]
    [MVCHTTPMethod([httpGET])]
    [MVCDoc('Returns the users list as a JSON Array of JSON Objects')]
    procedure GetUsers;

    //The following action will be with a PUT request like the following
    //http://myserver.com/users/3
    //and in the request body there should be a serialized TUser
    [MVCPath('/($id)')]
    [MVCProduce('application/json')]
    [MVCHTTPMethod([httpPUT])]
    [MVCDoc('Update a user')]    
    procedure UpdateUser(id: Integer);

    //The following action will respond to a POST request like the following
    //http://myserver.com/users
    //and in the request body there should be the new user to create as json
    [MVCPath]
    [MVCProduce('application/json')]
    [MVCHTTPMethod([httpPOST])]
    [MVCDoc('Create a new user, returns the id of the new user')]
    procedure CreateUser;

  end;
 
implementation

uses
  MyTransactionScript; //contains actual data access code
  
{ TUsersController }

procedure TUsersController.GetUsers;
var
  Users: TObjectList<TUser>;
begin
  Users := GetUsers;
  Render(Users);
end;
 
procedure TUsersController.GetUser(id: Integer);
var
  User: TUser;
begin
  User := GetUserById(id);
  Render(User);
end;

procedure TUsersController.UpdateUser(id: Integer);
var
  User: TUser;
begin
  User := Context.Request.BodyAs<TUser>;
  UpdateUser(id, User);
  Render(User);
end;	
  
procedure TUsersController.CreateUser;
var
  User: TUser;
begin
  User := Context.Request.BodyAs<TUser>;
  CreateUser(User);
  Render(User);
end;	
  
end.
```

Now you have a performant RESTful server wich respond to the following URLs:
- GET /users/($id)		(eg. /users/1, /users/45 etc)
- PUT /users/($id)		(eg. /users/1, /users/45 etc with the JSON data in the request body)
- POST /users			(the JSON data must be in the request body)

### Quick Creation of DelphiMVCFramework Server

If you dont plan to deploy your DMVCFramework server behind a webserver (apache or IIS) you can also pack more than one listener application server into one single executable. In this case, the process is a bit different and involves the creation of a listener context. However, create a new server is a simple task:

```delphi
uses
  MVCFramework.Server,
  MVCFramework.Server.Impl;

var
  LServerListener: IMVCListener;
begin
  LServerListener := TMVCListener.Create(TMVCListenerProperties.New
	 .SetName('Listener1')
	 .SetPort(5000)
	 .SetMaxConnections(1024)
	 .SetWebModuleClass(YourServerWebModuleClass)
   );  

  LServerListener.Start;
  LServerListener.Stop;
end;
```

If you want to add a layer of security (in its WebModule you should add the security middleware):

```delphi
uses
  MVCFramework.Server,
  MVCFramework.Server.Impl,
  MVCFramework.Middleware.Authentication;

procedure TTestWebModule.WebModuleCreate(Sender: TObject);
begin
  FMVCEngine := TMVCEngine.Create(Self);
	
  // Add Yours Controllers
  FMVCEngine.AddController(TYourController);
	
  // Add Security Middleware
  FMVCEngine.AddMiddleware(TMVCBasicAuthenticationMiddleware.Create(
    TMVCDefaultAuthenticationHandler.New
    .SetOnAuthentication(
		procedure(const AUserName, APassword: string;
		  AUserRoles: TList<string>; var IsValid: Boolean; 
		  const ASessionData: TDictionary<String, String>)
		begin
		  IsValid := AUserName.Equals('dmvc') and APassword.Equals('123');
		end
		)
    ));
end;  
```

In stand alone mode you can work with a context that supports multiple listeners servers:

```delphi
uses
  MVCFramework.Server,
  MVCFramework.Server.Impl;

var
  LServerListenerCtx: IMVCListenersContext;

begin
  LServerListenerCtx := TMVCListenersContext.Create;

  LServerListenerCtx.Add(TMVCListenerProperties.New
    .SetName('Listener1')
    .SetPort(6000)
    .SetMaxConnections(1024)
    .SetWebModuleClass(WebModuleClass1)
    );

  LServerListenerCtx.Add(TMVCListenerProperties.New
    .SetName('Listener2')
    .SetPort(7000)
    .SetMaxConnections(1024)
    .SetWebModuleClass(WebModuleClass2)
    );

  LServerListenerCtx.StartAll;
end;  
```
