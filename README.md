## Install the latest stable version

> If you are not involved in development or testing, do not clone the repo! Use the Github release!

The last stable version is **dmvcframework-3.2.1-carbon** available [here ðŸ“¥](https://github.com/danieleteti/delphimvcframework/releases/latest). Just download latest release as a zip file and you are ok. The samples are availables as separate zip file downloadable from the same page where you download the release.

## Book: "DelphiMVCFramework - the official guide"

The official guide for DMVCFramework is available. DMVCFramework has a lot functionalities and can really help your business. However many developers don't use it at its full potential. Why don't get more when is easily available? The DMVCFramework lead developer and project coordinator Daniele Teti, wrote the official guide for this great framework.

![DelphiMVCFramework - the official guide](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/danieleteti/delphimvcframework/master/docs/logoproject/dmvcframework_the_official_guide_very_small.png)

[Buy your copy](https://leanpub.com/delphimvcframework) and improve your DMVCFramework knowledge now!

> While a huge work has been done by the author and the reviews to make the book and the examples well written, complete and effective, things can be always improved. For any suggestions, complains or requests there is the official Github book project (https://github.com/danieleteti/dmvcframeworktheofficialguide) where you can fill an issue and get in touch directly with the author. 

### Book translations

Given the success of DMVCFramework in the Delphi community, the official DMVCFramework guide has been translated also in the following languages.

- [Brazilian Portuguese](https://leanpub.com/delphimvcframework-br) (Translated by Diego Farisato)
- [Spanish](https://leanpub.com/delphimvcframework-es) (Translated by JosÃ¨ Davalos)

### How to partecipate to DMVCFramework development and/or tests

Only if you want to participate to the testing phase (which usually contains brand new features but can sometimes be instable) you can get the development version clonig this repo or downloading the [master repository zip file](https://github.com/danieleteti/delphimvcframework/archive/master.zip).
Take in mind that even if development version is usually very stable, it isn't not ready for production utilization.

## What's New in DelphiMVCFramework 3.2.1-carbon

> This version is the version referenced by the [DelphiMVCFramework - The Official Guide](http://www.danieleteti.it/books/) book (available in english, portuguese and spanish). 

This version introduced new features in many different areas (swagger, server side view, MVCActiveRecord, renders etc.) however there is no a single-big-feature. This version contains also a good number of bugfixes. It's not a critical updated, but this is the *best version ever* (at least, so far...) and is the suggested version for starting new projects. Enjoy!

### Improvements

- [docExpansion parameter for Swagger](https://github.com/danieleteti/delphimvcframework/issues/408)

- New `Context: TWebContext` parameter in JSON-RPC Hooks

  ```delphi
  { Called before any actual routing }
  procedure OnBeforeRoutingHook(const Context: TWebContext; const JSON: TJsonObject);
  { Called after routing and before the actual remote method invocation }
  procedure OnBeforeCallHook(const Context: TWebContext; const JSON: TJsonObject);
  { Called after actual remote method invocation, even if the method raised an exception }
  procedure OnAfterCallHook(const Context: TWebContext; const JSON: TJsonObject);
  ```

- When a JSON-RPC Request returns a `System.Boolean` the `result` will be a JSON `true` or `false` and no `1` or `0` as it was in the `3.2.0-boron`.

- `IMVCJSONRPCExecutor.ExecuteNotification` returns a `IJSONRPCResponse`. In case of error response contains information about the error, in case of successful execution the response is a [Null Object](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Null_object_pattern).

- New React demo (Thanks to [Angelo Sobreira da Silva](https://github.com/angelosobreira))

- Serialization support for `TList<Integer>`, `TList<String>`, `TList<Boolean>` and for all `TList<T>` of simple types.

- Added  method `MetadataAsJSONObject(FieldNameCase: TMVCNameCase = ncLowerCase): TJSONObject;` in `TDataSetHelper`. This method returns the dataset field definitions. While this is valid only for Delphi datasets, can be useful to describe a dataset to a Delphi client.

  ```json
  {
  	"fielddefs": [
      	{
          	"datatype": 3,
              "displayname": "ID",
              "fieldname": "id",
              "precision": 0,
              "size": 0
           },
           {
           	"datatype": 24,
              "displayname": "CODE",
              "fieldname": "code",
              "precision": 0,
              "size": 5
           },
           {
           	"datatype": 24,
              "displayname": "DESCRIPTION",
              "fieldname": "description",
              "precision": 0,
              "size": 200
           },
           {
           	"datatype": 37,
              "displayname": "PRICE",
              "fieldname": "price",
              "precision": 18,
              "size": 2
            }
        ]
  }
  ```

  The static method `class procedure TFireDACUtils.CreateDatasetFromMetadata(
    AFDMemTable: TFDMemTable; AMeta: TJSONObject);` gets the previous structure and initialize the fields of `AFDMemTable` with it. When a TFDMemTable is initialized using this approach, the data can be directly loaded from a jsonarray of jsonobject with the same field names. *WARNING: This mechanism works only for Delphi clients*. Check sample `articles_crud_vcl_client_meta.dproj` to understand the involved mechanisms. 

- Added `foReadOnly` and `foWriteOnly` as field options in `MVCTableField` attribute (used by `TMVCActiveRecord`). Currently available field options are:

  - *foPrimaryKey* { it's the primary key of the mapped table }
  - *foAutoGenerated* { not written, read - similar to foReadOnly but is reloaded after insert and update }
  - *foTransient* { never stored nor read - managed only at run-time }
  - *foReadOnly* { not written, read }
  - *foWriteOnly* { written, not read }

  Now it is possible to declare entities like the followings (or with any other combinations):

  ```delphi
    [MVCNameCase(ncLowerCase)]
    [MVCTable('articles')]
    TArticleWithWriteOnlyFields = class(TCustomEntity)
    private
      [MVCTableField('ID', [foPrimaryKey, foAutoGenerated])]
      fID: NullableInt32;
      [MVCTableField('description', [foWriteOnly])]
      fDescription: string;
      [MVCTableField('price', [foWriteOnly])]
      fPrice: Integer;
    public
      property ID: NullableInt32 read fID write fID;
      property Description: string read fDescription write fDescription;
      property Price: Integer read fPrice write fPrice;
    end;
  
    [MVCNameCase(ncLowerCase)]
    [MVCTable('articles')]
    TArticleWithReadOnlyFields = class(TCustomEntity)
    private
      [MVCTableField('ID', [foPrimaryKey, foReadOnly])]
      fID: NullableInt32;
      [MVCTableField('code', [foTransient])]
      fCode: NullableString;
      [MVCTableField('description', [foReadOnly])]
      fDescrizione: string;
      [MVCTableField('price', [foReadOnly])]
      fPrice: Currency;
    public
      property ID: NullableInt32 read fID write fID;
      property Code: NullableString read fCode write fCode;
      property Description: string read fDescription write fDescription;
      property Price: Currency read fPrice write fPrice;
    end;
  ```

- Added the ability to deserialize an object, or alist of objects, starting from an arbitrary node in the JSON (or other format) present in the request body. Works for `BodyAs<T>` and for `BodyAsListOf<T>` (Thanks to [RaphaÃ«l Emourgeon](https://github.com/osaris) for the `BodyAsListOf<T>` [implementation](https://github.com/danieleteti/delphimvcframework/issues/415)).

  ```delphi
  procedure TBooksController.CreateBook;
  var
    lBook: TBook;
  begin
    //this call deserialize a TBook instance
    //starting from the 'book' node of
    //the request body
    lBook := Context.Request.BodyAs<TBook>('book');
    try
      lBook.Insert;
      Render201Created('/api/books/' + lBook.ID.ToString);
    finally
      lBook.Free;
    end;
  end;
  ```

- Improved the primary key type handling for manual handling in MVCActiveRecord.

  ```delphi
  procedure TMyBaseEntity.OnBeforeInsert;
  begin
    inherited;
    //regardless the name of the PK field
    //the following code fills the PK with a GUID
    //Inheriting the other entities from this, all
    //will inherit this behavior.
    SetPK(TValue.From<NullableString>(TGUID.NewGuid.ToString));
    
    //if the PK was a simple string, the code
    //should be like the following
    //SetPK(TGUID.NewGuid.ToString);  
  end;
  
  ```

- Improved `activerecord_showcase` sample.

- Improved `TMVCStaticFilesMiddleware`. Now is able to correctly serve SPA applications from any subfolder.

- Added property `Context.HostingFrameworkType`. This property is of type `TMVCHostingFrameworkType` and can assume one of the following values: `hftIndy` (if the service is using the built-in Indy HTTP server) , `hftApache` (if the project is compiled as Apache module) or `hftISAPI` (if the project is compiled as ISAPI module).

- `TMVCNameCase` got the new `ncSnakeCase` among the possibles casing (thanks to [JoÃ£o AntÃ´nio Duarte](https://github.com/joaoduarte19) for its work in this area). 

  Now the `TMVCNameCase` declaration is the following:

  ```delphi
  TMVCNameCase = (ncAsIs, ncUpperCase, ncLowerCase, ncCamelCase, ncPascalCase, ncSnakeCase);
  ```

  Here's how the new `ncSnakeCase` works

  | Original | SnakeCase  |
  | -------- | ---------- |
  | OneTwo   | one_two    |
  | One__Two | one_two    |
  | OneTwo03 | one_two_03 |

- Support for [Mustache](https://mustache.github.io/) partials (Thanks to [David Moorhouse](https://github.com/fastbike) and his work about [issue 221](https://github.com/danieleteti/delphimvcframework/issues/221)). Sample *\samples\serversideviews_mustache* has been updated to show how to use partials.

- Added dynamic properties access to `TMVCActiveRecord` descendants. Indexed property `Attributes` is index using the property name and set/get a `TValue` representing the property value.

  ```delphi
  procedure TMainForm.btnAttributesClick(Sender: TObject);
  var
    lCustomer: TCustomer;
    lID: Integer;
  begin
    lCustomer := TCustomer.Create;
    try
      lCustomer.Attributes['CompanyName'] := 'Google Inc.';
      lCustomer.Attributes['City'] := 'Montain View, CA';
      lCustomer.Attributes['Note'] := 'Hello there!';
      lCustomer.Attributes['Code'] := 'XX123';
      lCustomer.Attributes['Rating'] := 3;
      lCustomer.Insert;
      lID := lCustomer.ID;
    finally
      lCustomer.Free;
    end;
  
    lCustomer := TMVCActiveRecord.GetByPK<TCustomer>(lID);
    try
      Assert('Google Inc.' = 
      	lCustomer.Attributes['CompanyName']
      		.AsType<NullableString>().Value);
      Assert('Montain View, CA' = 	
      	lCustomer.Attributes['City'].AsString);
      Assert('XX123' = 
      	lCustomer.Attributes['Code']
      		.AsType<NullableString>().Value);
      Assert('Hello there!' = 
      	lCustomer.Attributes['Note'].AsString);
      lCustomer.Update;
    finally
      lCustomer.Free;
    end;
  ```

- **Breaking Change**! `TMVCStaticFileMiddleware` cannot be registered to "/" anymore 

  - The suggested solution is to create a simple redirection controller which redirect "/" to the proper path (check [this example](https://github.com/danieleteti/delphimvcframework/blob/master/samples/middleware_staticfiles/SPARedirectController.pas)).

- **Breaking Change!**  `DocumentRoot` of `TMVCStaticFileMiddleware`  must be a valid folder. If `DocumentRoot` doesn't exist an exception is raised.

## Next Release: 3.2.2-nitrogen ("repo" version)

- âš¡New `TMVCRESTClient` implementation based on *Net components, the previous one was based on INDY Components (thanks to [JoÃ£o AntÃ´nio Duarte](https://github.com/joaoduarte19)).
- âš¡New! `MVCJSONRPCAllowGET` attribute allows a remote JSON-RPC published object, or a specific method, to be called using GET HTTP Verb as well as POST HTTP Verb. POST is always available, GET is available only if explicitly allowed. `IMVCJSONRPCExecutor` allows to specify which HTTP Verb to use when call the server JSON.RPC methods. The default verb can be injected in the constructor and each `ExecuteRequest`/`ExecuteNotification` allows to override od adhere to the instance default.
- âš¡Improved! Under some heavy load circumnstances the logger queue can get full. Now `TThreadSafeQueue` class uses a cubic function instead of a linear one to wait in case of very high concurrency. This allows a better resiliency in case of high load.
- âš¡Improved internal architecture of custom type serializers in case of dynamic linked packages.
- âš¡New `TMVCLRUCache` implementation. Very efficient implementation of LRU cache borrowed directly from [DMSContainer](http://dmscontainer.bittimeprofessionals.com/)
- âš¡New! `TMVCActiveRecord` supports XML field type in PostgreSQL (in addition to JSON and JSONB).
- âš¡Improved! Add parameter to set local timeStamp as UTC.
- âš¡Improved OpenAPI (Swagger) support.
- âš¡Improved! The unit tests fully test PostgreSQL, FirebirdSQL and SQLite while testing MVCActiveRecord framework. The other engines are tested using `activerecord_showcase` sample project.
- âš¡Improved! MVCActiveRecord doeas a better job to handle TDate/TTime/TDateTime types for SQLite (it is automatic because SQLite doesn't support date/time types).
- âš¡Improved! PostgreSQL, FirebirdSQL, Interbase and SQLite now support tablename and fields with spaces.

- New! Added Swagger support (thanks to [JoÃ£o AntÃ´nio Duarte](https://github.com/joaoduarte19) and [Geoffrey Smith](https://github.com/geoffsmith82))

- New! Attribute `MVCDoNotDeserialize`. If marked with this RTTI attribute, a property or a field is not deserialized and its value remain the same as was before the object deserialization.

- New! Added SQLGenerator and RQL compiler for PostgreSQL, SQLite and MSSQLServer (in addition to MySQL, MariaDB, Firebird and Interbase)

- New! *MVCNameAs* attribute got the param `Fixed` (default: false). If `Fixed` is true, then the name is not processed by the `MVCNameCase` attribute assigned to the owner type.
- New! Added support for interfaces serialization - now it is possible to serialize Spring4D collections (thanks to [JoÃ£o AntÃ´nio Duarte](https://github.com/joaoduarte19))
- New! Added support for rendering Spring4D Nullable Types - (thanks to [JoÃ£o AntÃ´nio Duarte](https://github.com/joaoduarte19))
- New! Added `OnRouterLog` event to log custom information for each request (thanks to [Andrea Ciotti](https://github.com/andreaciotti) for the first implementation and its PR)
- New! Optionally load system controllers (those who provide `/describeserver.info`, `/describeplatform.info` and `/serverconfig.info` system actions) setting `Config[TMVCConfigKey.LoadSystemControllers] := 'false';` in the configuration block.
- Improved! Now the router consider `Accept:*/*` compatible for every `MVCProduces` values.
- Improved! Greatly improved support for [HATEOAS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HATEOAS) in renders. Check `TRenderSampleController.GetPeople_AsObjectList_HATEOS` and all the others actions end with `HATEOS` in `renders.dproj` sample).

```delphi
//Now is really easy to add "links" property automatically for each collection element while rendering
Render<TPerson>(People, True,
    procedure(const APerson: TPerson; const Links: IMVCLinks)
    begin
      Links.AddRefLink
        .Add(HATEOAS.HREF, '/people/' + APerson.ID.ToString)
        .Add(HATEOAS.REL, 'self')
        .Add(HATEOAS._TYPE, 'application/json')
        .Add('title', 'Details for ' + APerson.FullName);
      Links.AddRefLink
        .Add(HATEOAS.HREF, '/people')
        .Add(HATEOAS.REL, 'people')
        .Add(HATEOAS._TYPE, 'application/json');
    end);

		
//Datasets have a similar anon method to do the same thing
Render(lDM.qryCustomers, False,
  procedure(const DS: TDataset; const Links: IMVCLinks)
  begin
	Links.AddRefLink
	  .Add(HATEOAS.HREF, '/customers/' + DS.FieldByName('cust_no').AsString)
	  .Add(HATEOAS.REL, 'self')
	  .Add(HATEOAS._TYPE, 'application/json');
	Links.AddRefLink
	  .Add(HATEOAS.HREF, '/customers/' + DS.FieldByName('cust_no').AsString + '/orders')
	  .Add(HATEOAS.REL, 'orders')
	  .Add(HATEOAS._TYPE, 'application/json');
  end);

//Single object rendering allows HATEOAS too!
Render(lPerson, False,
  procedure(const AObject: TObject; const Links: IMVCLinks)
  begin
	Links.AddRefLink
	  .Add(HATEOAS.HREF, '/people/' + TPerson(AObject).ID.ToString)
	  .Add(HATEOAS.REL, 'self')
	  .Add(HATEOAS._TYPE, TMVCMediaType.APPLICATION_JSON);
	Links.AddRefLink
	  .Add(HATEOAS.HREF, '/people')
	  .Add(HATEOAS.REL, 'people')
	  .Add(HATEOAS._TYPE, TMVCMediaType.APPLICATION_JSON);
  end);
	
```

- Better packages organization (check `packages` folder)
- New! `TMVCActiveRecord.Count` method (e.g. `TMVCActiveRecord.Count(TCustomer)` returns the number of records for the entity mapped by the class `TCustomer`)
- Change! `TMVCACtiveRecord.GetByPK<T>` raises an exception by default if the record is not found - optionally can returns `nil` using new parameter `RaiseExceptionIfNotFound` 
- New! `contains` clause has been added in the RQL compiler for Firebird and Interbase
- New! Added support out operator in RQL parser. The RQL out operator is equivalent to the SQL NOT IN operator.
- New! `TMVCAnalyticsMiddleware` to do automatic analytics on the API (generates a CSV file). Based on an idea by Nirav Kaku (https://www.facebook.com/nirav.kaku). Check the sample in `\samples\middleware_analytics\`
- New! `TMVCActiveRecord.DeleteAll` deletes all the records from a table
- New! `TMVCActiveRecord.DeleteRQL` deletes records using an `RQL` expression as `where` clause.
- New! `TMVCActiveRecord.Store` which automatically executes Insert or Update considering primary key value.
- New! `TMVCActiveRecord` allows to use table name and field name with spaces (currently supported only by the PostgreSQL compiler). 
- New! Microsoft SQLServer Support in `MVCActiveRecord` and RQL (*thanks to one of the biggest Delphi based company in Italy which heavily uses DMVCFramework* and *[DMSContainer](http://www.bittimeprofessionals.it/prodotti/dmscontainer)*).
- New! SQLite support in `MVCActiveRecord` and RQL, so that `MVCActiveRecord` can be used also for Delphi mobile projects!
- Default JSON Serializer can verbatim pass properties with type `JsonDataObjects.TJSONObject` without  using `string` as carrier of JSON.
- Improved! `ActiveRecordShowCase` sample is much better now.
- Improved! All `ActiveRecord` methods which retrieve records can now specify the data type of each parameter (using Delphi's `TFieldType` enumeration).
- Improved! In case of unhandled exception `TMVCEngine` is compliant with the default response content-type (usually it did would reply using `text/plain`).
- Added! New overloads for all the Log\* calls. Now it is possible to call `LogD(lMyObject)` to get logged `lMyObject` as JSON (custom type serializers not supported in log).
- New! `StrDict(array of string, array of string)` function allows to render a dictionary of strings in a really simple way. See the following action sample.

```delphi
procedure TMy.GetPeople(const Value: Integer);
begin
  if Value mod 2 <> 0 then
  begin
    raise EMVCException.Create(HTTP_STATUS.NotAcceptable, 'We don''t like odd numbers');
  end;
  Render(
    StrDict(
      ['id', 'message'],
      ['123', 'We like even numbers, thank you for your ' + Value.ToString]
    ));
end;
```

- New! Custom Exception Handling (Based on work of [David Moorhouse](https://github.com/fastbike)). Sample *custom_exception_handling* show how to use it.
- Improved! Exceptions rendering while using MIME types different to `application/json`.
- SSL Server support for `TMVCListener` (Thanks to [Sven Harazim](https://github.com/landrix)).
- Improved! Datasets serialization speed improvement. In some case the performance [improves of 2 order of magnitude](https://github.com/danieleteti/delphimvcframework/issues/205#issuecomment-479513158). (Thanks to https://github.com/pedrooliveira01).
- New! Added `in` operator in RQL parser (Thank you to [JoÃ£o AntÃ´nio Duarte](https://github.com/joaoduarte19) for his initial work on this).
- New! Added `TMVCActiveRecord.Count<T>(RQL)` to count record based on RQL criteria.
- New! `TMVCActiveRecord` can handle non  autogenerated primary key.
- New! Added support for `X-HTTP-Method-Override` to work behind corporate firewalls.
- New Sample! Server in DLL
- Added new method in the dataset helper to load data into a dataset from a specific JSONArray property of a JSONObject   `procedure TDataSetHelper.LoadJSONArrayFromJSONObjectProperty(const AJSONObjectString: string; const aPropertyName: String);` 
- Improved! New constants defined in `HTTP_STATUS` to better describe the http status response.
- Improved! Now Firebird RQL' SQLGenerator can include primary key in `CreateInsert` if not autogenerated.
- New! Added support for `TArray<String>`, `TArray<Integer>` and `TArray<Double>` in default JSON serializer (Thank you [Pedro Oliveira](https://github.com/pedrooliveira01))
- Improved JWT Standard Compliance! Thanks to [Vinicius Sanchez](https://github.com/viniciussanchez) for his work on [issue #241](https://github.com/danieleteti/delphimvcframework/issues/241)
- Improved! DMVCFramework now has 180+ unit tests that checks its functionalities at each build!
- Improved! Better exception handling in `OnBeforeDispatch` (Thanks to [Spinettaro](https://github.com/spinettaro))
- New! `StrToJSONObject` function to safely parse a string into a JSON object.
- New! Serialization callback for custom `TDataSet` descendants serialization in `TMVCJsonDataObjectsSerializer`.

```delphi
procedure TMainForm.btnDataSetToJSONArrayClick(Sender: TObject);
var
  lSer: TMVCJsonDataObjectsSerializer;
  lJArray: TJSONArray;
begin
  FDQuery1.Open();
  lSer := TMVCJsonDataObjectsSerializer.Create;
  try
    lJArray := TJSONArray.Create;
    try
      lSer.DataSetToJsonArray(FDQuery1, lJArray, TMVCNameCase.ncLowerCase, [],
        procedure(const aField: TField; const aJsonObject: TJSONObject; var Handled: Boolean)
        begin
          if SameText(aField.FieldName, 'created_at') then
          begin
            aJsonObject.S['year_and_month'] := FormatDateTime('yyyy-mm', TDateTimeField(aField).Value);
            Handled := True;
          end;
        end);
	  //The json objects will not contains "created_at" anymore, but only "year_and_month".
      Memo1.Lines.Text := lJArray.ToJSON(false);
    finally
      lJArray.Free;
    end;
  finally
    lSer.Free;
  end;
end;
```

- New! Shortcut render' methods which simplify RESTful API development

  - `procedure Render201Created(const Location: String = ''; const Reason: String = 'Created'); virtual;`
  - `    procedure Render202Accepted(const HREF: String; const ID: String; const Reason: String = 'Accepted'); virtual;`
  - `procedure Render204NoContent(const Reason: String = 'No Content'); virtual;`

- Added de/serializing iterables (e.g. generic lists) support without `MVCListOf` attribute (Thank you to [JoÃ£o AntÃ´nio Duarte](https://github.com/joaoduarte19)).

  It is now possible to deserialize a generic class like this:

  ```delphi
    TGenericEntity<T: class> = class
    private
      FCode: Integer;
      FItems: TObjectList<T>;
      FDescription: string;
    public
      constructor Create;
      destructor Destroy; override;
      property Code: Integer read FCode write FCode;
      property Description: string read FDescription write FDescription;
      // MVCListOf(T) <- No need
      property Items: TObjectList<T> read FItems write FItems;
    end;
  ```

  Before it was not possible because you should add the `MVCListOf` attribute to the `TObjectList` type property.

- New! Added serialization support for (thanks to [dockerandy](https://github.com/dockerandy) for his initial work)

  -  `TArray<String>`
  -  `TArray<Integer>`
  -  `TArray<Int64>`
  -  `TArray<Double>`

- New! The **MVCAREntitiesGenerator** can optionally register all the generated entities also in the `ActiveRecordMappingRegistry` (Thanks to [Fabrizio Bitti](https://twitter.com/fabriziobitti) from [bit Time Software](http://www.bittime.it))

- New! Experimental (alpha stage) support for Android servers!

- New! Children objects lifecycle management in `TMVCActiveRecord` (methods `AddChildren` and `RemoveChildren`). Really useful to manage child objects such relations or derived properties and are safe in case of multiple addition of the same object as children.

  ```delphi
  //Having the following declaration
  
  type
    [MVCNameCase(ncCamelCase)]
    [MVCTable('authors')]
    TAuthor = class(TPersonEntityBase)
    private
      fBooks: TEnumerable<TBookRef>;
      [MVCTableField('full_name')]
      fFullName: string;
      function GetBooks: TEnumerable<TBookRef>;
    public
      [MVCNameAs('full_name')]
      property FullName: string read fFullName write fFullName;
      property Books: TEnumerable<TBookRef> read GetBooks;
    end;
  
  
  //method GetBooks can be implemented as follows:
  
  implementation
  
  function TAuthor.GetBooks: TEnumerable<TBookRef>;
  begin
    if fBooks = nil then
    begin
      fBooks := TMVCActiveRecord.Where<TBookRef>('author_id = ?', [ID]);
      AddChildren(fBooks); //fBooks will be freed when self will be freed
    end;
    Result := fBooks;
  end;
  ```

  

- **JSON-RPC Improvements**

  - New! Added `TMVCJSONRPCExecutor.ConfigHTTPClient` to fully customize the inner `THTTPClient` (e.g. `ConnectionTimeout`, `ResponseTimeout` and so on)

  - Improved! JSONRPC Automatic Object Publishing can not invoke inherited methods if not explicitly defined with `MVCInheritable` attribute.

  - New! Calling `<jsonrpcendpoint>/describe` returns the methods list available for that endpoint.

  - New! Full support for named parameters in JSON-RPC call (server and client)

    - Positional parameters example

      ```delphi
      procedure TMainForm.btnSubtractClick(Sender: TObject);
      var
        lReq: IJSONRPCRequest;
        lResp: IJSONRPCResponse;
      begin
        lReq := TJSONRPCRequest.Create;
        lReq.Method := 'subtract';
        lReq.RequestID := Random(1000);
        lReq.Params.Add(StrToInt(edtValue1.Text));
        lReq.Params.Add(StrToInt(edtValue2.Text));
        lResp := FExecutor.ExecuteRequest(lReq);
        edtResult.Text := lResp.Result.AsInteger.ToString;
      end;
      ```

    - Named parameters example

      ```delphi
      procedure TMainForm.btnSubtractWithNamedParamsClick(Sender: TObject);
      var
        lReq: IJSONRPCRequest;
        lResp: IJSONRPCResponse;
      begin
        lReq := TJSONRPCRequest.Create;
        lReq.Method := 'subtract';
        lReq.RequestID := Random(1000);
        lReq.Params.AddByName('Value1', StrToInt(Edit1.Text));
        lReq.Params.AddByName('Value2', StrToInt(Edit2.Text));
        lResp := FExecutor.ExecuteRequest(lReq);
        Edit3.Text := lResp.Result.AsInteger.ToString;
      end;
      ```

    - Check [official JSONRPC 2.0 documentation](https://www.jsonrpc.org/specification#examples) for more examples.

  - New! JSONRPC Hooks for published objects

    ```delphi
    //Called before as soon as the HTTP arrives
    procedure TMyPublishedObject.OnBeforeRouting(const JSON: TJDOJsonObject);
    
    //Called before the invoked method
    procedure TMyPublishedObject.OnBeforeCall(const JSONRequest: TJDOJsonObject);
    
    //Called just before to send response to the client
    procedure TMyPublishedObject.OnBeforeSendResponse(const JSONResponse: TJDOJsonObject);
    
    ```

    

- **Deprecated!** `TDataSetHolder` is deprecated! Use the shining new `ObjectDict(boolean)` instead.

- New! **ObjectDict** function is the suggested way to render all the most common data types. It returns a `IMVCObjectDictionary` which is automatically rendered by the renders. Check the `renders.dproj` sample. Here's some example of the shining new `ObjectDict()`.

  **Example 1: Rendering a list of objects not freeing them after rendering**

  *Classic*

  ```delphi
  procedure TRenderSampleController.GetLotOfPeople;
  begin
    Render<TPerson>(GetPeopleList, False);
  end;
  ```

  *New approach with ObjectDict*

  ```delphi
  procedure TRenderSampleController.GetLotOfPeople;
  begin
    Render(ObjectDict(False).Add('data', GetPeopleList));
  end;
  ```

  

  **Example 2: Rendering  a list of objects and automatically free them  after rendering**

  *Classic*

  ```delphi
  procedure TRenderSampleController.GetLotOfPeople;
  begin
    Render<TPerson>(GetPeopleList);
  end;
  
  ```

  *New approach with ObjectDict*

  ```delphi
  procedure TRenderSampleController.GetLotOfPeople;
  begin
    Render(ObjectDict().Add('data', GetPeopleList));
  end;
  
  ```

  **Example 3: Rendering  a list of objects adding links for HATEOAS support**

  *Classic*

  ```delphi
  procedure TRenderSampleController.GetPeople_AsObjectList_HATEOAS;
  var
    p: TPerson;
    People: TObjectList<TPerson>;
  begin
    People := TObjectList<TPerson>.Create(True);
  
  {$REGION 'Fake data'}
    p := TPerson.Create;
    p.FirstName := 'Daniele';
    p.LastName := 'Teti';
    p.DOB := EncodeDate(1979, 8, 4);
    p.Married := True;
    People.Add(p);
  
    p := TPerson.Create;
    p.FirstName := 'John';
    p.LastName := 'Doe';
    p.DOB := EncodeDate(1879, 10, 2);
    p.Married := False;
    People.Add(p);
  
    p := TPerson.Create;
    p.FirstName := 'Jane';
    p.LastName := 'Doe';
    p.DOB := EncodeDate(1883, 1, 5);
    p.Married := True;
    People.Add(p);
  {$ENDREGION}
  
    Render<TPerson>(People, True,
      procedure(const APerson: TPerson; const Links: IMVCLinks)
      begin
        Links
         .AddRefLink
         .Add(HATEOAS.HREF, '/people/' + APerson.ID.ToString)
         .Add(HATEOAS.REL, 'self')
         .Add(HATEOAS._TYPE, 'application/json')
         .Add('title', 'Details for ' + APerson.FullName);
        Links
         .AddRefLink
         .Add(HATEOAS.HREF, '/people')
         .Add(HATEOAS.REL, 'people')
         .Add(HATEOAS._TYPE, 'application/json');
      end);
  end;
  
  ```

  *New approach with ObjectDict*

  ```delphi
  procedure TRenderSampleController.GetPeople_AsObjectList_HATEOAS;
  var
    p: TPerson;
    People: TObjectList<TPerson>;
  begin
    People := TObjectList<TPerson>.Create(True);
  
  {$REGION 'Fake data'}
    p := TPerson.Create;
    p.FirstName := 'Daniele';
    p.LastName := 'Teti';
    p.DOB := EncodeDate(1979, 8, 4);
    p.Married := True;
    People.Add(p);
  
    p := TPerson.Create;
    p.FirstName := 'John';
    p.LastName := 'Doe';
    p.DOB := EncodeDate(1879, 10, 2);
    p.Married := False;
    People.Add(p);
  
    p := TPerson.Create;
    p.FirstName := 'Jane';
    p.LastName := 'Doe';
    p.DOB := EncodeDate(1883, 1, 5);
    p.Married := True;
    People.Add(p);
  
  {$ENDREGION}
   
    Render(ObjectDict().Add('data', People,
      procedure(const APerson: TObject; const Links: IMVCLinks)
      begin
        Links
          .AddRefLink
          .Add(HATEOAS.HREF, '/people/' + TPerson(APerson).ID.ToString)
          .Add(HATEOAS.REL, 'self')
          .Add(HATEOAS._TYPE, 'application/json')
          .Add('title', 'Details for ' + TPerson(APerson).FullName);
        Links
          .AddRefLink
          .Add(HATEOAS.HREF, '/people')
          .Add(HATEOAS.REL, 'people')
          .Add(HATEOAS._TYPE, 'application/json');
      end));
  end;
  
  ```

  `ObjectDict` is able to render multiple data sources (datasets, objectlists, objects or StrDict) at the same time using different casing, HATEOAS callbacks and modes.

  ```delphi
  procedure TTestServerController.TestObjectDict;
  var
    lDict: IMVCObjectDictionary;
  begin
    lDict := ObjectDict(false)
      .Add('ncUpperCase_List', GetDataSet, nil, dstAllRecords, ncUpperCase)
      .Add('ncLowerCase_List', GetDataSet, nil, dstAllRecords, ncLowerCase)
      .Add('ncCamelCase_List', GetDataSet, nil, dstAllRecords, ncCamelCase)
      .Add('ncPascalCase_List', GetDataSet, nil, dstAllRecords, ncPascalCase)
      .Add('ncUpperCase_Single', GetDataSet, nil, dstSingleRecord, ncUpperCase)
      .Add('ncLowerCase_Single', GetDataSet, nil, dstSingleRecord, ncLowerCase)
      .Add('ncCamelCase_Single', GetDataSet, nil, dstSingleRecord, ncCamelCase)
      .Add('ncPascalCase_Single', GetDataSet, nil, dstSingleRecord, ncPascalCase)
      .Add('meta', StrDict(['page'], ['1']));
    Render(lDict);
  end;
  
  ```

  >ObjectDict is the suggested way to renders data. However, the other ones are still there and works as usual.

- Added ability to serialize/deserialize types enumerated by an array of mapped values (Thanks to [JoÃ£o AntÃ´nio Duarte](https://github.com/joaoduarte19)).

  ```delphi
  type
    TMonthEnum = (meJanuary, meFebruary, meMarch, meApril);
  
    TEntityWithEnums = class
    private
      FMonthMappedNames: TMonthEnum;
      FMonthEnumName: TMonthEnum;    
      FMonthOrder: TMonthEnum;    
    public
      // List items separated by comma or semicolon
      [MVCEnumSerializationType(estEnumMappedValues,
      	'January,February,March,April')]
      property MonthMappedNames: TMonthEnum 
      	read FMonthMappedNames write FMonthMappedNames;
      [MVCEnumSerializationType(estEnumName)]
      property MonthEnumName: TMonthEnum 
      	read FMonthEnumName write FMonthEnumName;
      [MVCEnumSerializationType(estEnumOrd)]
      property MonthOrder: TMonthEnum read FMonthOrder write FMonthOrder;
    end;
  ...
  ```

#### Breaking Changes in 3.2.0-boron

- In `MVCActiveRecord` attribute `MVCPrimaryKey` has been removed and merged with `MVCTableField`, so now `TMVCActiveRecordFieldOption` is a set of `foPrimaryKey`, `foAutoGenerated`, `foTransient` (check `activerecord_showcase.dproj` sample).

- Middleware `OnAfterControllerAction` are now invoked in the same order of `OnBeforeControllerAction` (previously were invoked in reversed order).

- `TMVCEngine` is no more responsible for static file serving. If you need static files used the new `TMVCStaticFilesMiddleware` (check the sample). As consequence `TMVCConfigKey.DocumentRoot`, `TMVCConfigKey.IndexDocument` and `TMVCConfigKey.FallbackResource` are no more available.

- `TMVCEngine.Config` property is now read-only. Can be changed only in the anonymous method injected in the constructor.

  ```delphi
  // This is valid
  ////////////////////////////////////////
  FMVC := TMVCEngine.Create(Self,
    procedure(Config: TMVCConfig)
    begin
      // session timeout (0 means session cookie)
      Config[TMVCConfigKey.SessionTimeout] := '0';
      //Other Configurations

## Roadmap

DelphiMVCFramework roadmap is always updated as-soon-as the features planned are implemented. Check the roadmap [here](roadmap.md).

## Trainings, consultancy or custom development service
As you know, good support on open source software is a must for professional users.
If you need trainings, consultancy or custom developments on DelphiMVCFramework, send an email to *dmvcframework at bittime dot it*. Alternatively you can send a request using the [contacts forms](http://www.bittimeprofessionals.it/contatti) on [bit Time Professionals website](http://www.bittimeprofessionals.it). bit Time Professionals is the company behind DelphiMVCFramework, all the main developers works there.

## Samples and documentation
DMVCFramework is provided with a lot of examples focused on specific functionality.
All samples are in [Samples](samples) folder.

# Getting Started: 5 minutes guide

DMVCFramework allows to create powerful RESTful servers without effort. You can create a full-flagged RESTful server in a couple of clicks.

## DelphiMVCFramework Installation

- DMVCFramework *must* be installed using the [Github release](https://github.com/danieleteti/delphimvcframework/releases/tag/v3_2_0_boron). Download the zip file

- Unzip it the release zip in a folder named `C:\dmvc` (or where you prefer).

- Launch RAD Studio and open `C:\dmvc\packages\d104\dmvcframework_group.groupproj`

  > WARNING! In the last path shown "d104" is for Delphi 10.4 Sydney. Use the correct package for your Delphi version.

- Install the package and close all

- Now, DMVCFramework expert is installed and you are able to create DMVCFramework project. Go to go to `File->New->Other` select `Delphi Project->DMVC->DelphiMVCFramework Project`

  ![](docs/getting_started_10_ide_expert_new_project.png)

- From the resultant dialog, leave all the default settings and click `OK`
- If you try to compile the project now, you will get compiler errors because we've to configure the library paths to let the compiler finds the needed source files
- go to `Tools->Options->Language->Delphi->Library` and add in the `Library Path` the following paths:
  - C:\DMVC\sources
  - C:\DMVC\lib\dmustache
  - C:\DMVC\lib\loggerpro
  - C:\DMVC\lib\swagdoc\Source
- Run the project (F9)
- Now, a new console application is running serving you first DMVCFramework server. 
- Simple, isn't it?
- The wizard generated controller shown some basic setup and some actions. You can start from here to create your application. Use the huge number of sample to understand how each DMVCFramwork feature work.

## Sample Controller

Below a basic sample of a DMVCFramework controller with 2 action

```delphi
unit UsersControllerU;
  
interface
  
uses 
  MVCFramework;
 
type 
   [MVCPath('/users')]
   TUsersController = class(TMVCController)
   public

    //The following action will be with a GET request like the following
    //http://myserver.com/users/3
    [MVCPath('/($id)')]
    [MVCProduces('application/json')]
    [MVCHTTPMethod([httpGET])]
    [MVCDoc('Returns a user as a JSON object')]
    procedure GetUser(id: Integer);

    
    //The following action will be with a GET request like the following
    //http://myserver.com/users
    [MVCPath('/')]
    [MVCProduces('application/json')]
    [MVCHTTPMethod([httpGET])]
    [MVCDoc('Returns the users list as a JSON Array of JSON Objects')]
    procedure GetUsers;

    //The following action will be with a PUT request like the following
    //http://myserver.com/users/3
    //and in the request body there should be a serialized TUser
    [MVCPath('/($id)')]
    [MVCProduce('application/json')]
    [MVCHTTPMethod([httpPUT])]
    [MVCDoc('Update a user')]    
    procedure UpdateUser(id: Integer);

    //The following action will respond to a POST request like the following
    //http://myserver.com/users
    //and in the request body there should be the new user to create as json
    [MVCPath]
    [MVCProduce('application/json')]
    [MVCHTTPMethod([httpPOST])]
    [MVCDoc('Create a new user, returns the id of the new user')]
    procedure CreateUser;

  end;
 
implementation

uses
  MyTransactionScript; //contains actual data access code
  
{ TUsersController }

procedure TUsersController.GetUsers;
var
  Users: TObjectList<TUser>;
begin
  Users := GetUsers;
  Render(Users);
end;
 
procedure TUsersController.GetUser(id: Integer);
var
  User: TUser;
begin
  User := GetUserById(id);
  Render(User);
end;

procedure TUsersController.UpdateUser(id: Integer);
var
  User: TUser;
begin
  User := Context.Request.BodyAs<TUser>;
  UpdateUser(id, User);
  Render(User);
end;	
  
procedure TUsersController.CreateUser;
var
  User: TUser;
begin
  User := Context.Request.BodyAs<TUser>;
  CreateUser(User);
  Render(User);
end;	
  
end.
```

Now you have a performant RESTful server wich respond to the following URLs:
- GET /users/($id)		(eg. /users/1, /users/45 etc)
- PUT /users/($id)		(eg. /users/1, /users/45 etc with the JSON data in the request body)
- POST /users			(the JSON data must be in the request body)

## How to create a dmvcframework servers container

If you don't plan to deploy your DMVCFramework server behind a webserver (apache or IIS) you can also pack more than one listener application server into one single executable. In this case, the process is a bit different and involves the creation of a listener context. However, create a new server is a simple task:

```delphi
uses
  MVCFramework.Server,
  MVCFramework.Server.Impl;

var
  LServerListener: IMVCListener;
begin
  LServerListener := TMVCListener.Create(TMVCListenerProperties.New
	 .SetName('Listener1')
	 .SetPort(5000)
	 .SetMaxConnections(1024)
	 .SetWebModuleClass(YourServerWebModuleClass)
   );  

  LServerListener.Start;
  LServerListener.Stop;
end;
```

If you want to add a layer of security (in its WebModule you should add the security middleware):

```delphi
uses
  MVCFramework.Server,
  MVCFramework.Server.Impl,
  MVCFramework.Middleware.Authentication;

procedure TTestWebModule.WebModuleCreate(Sender: TObject);
begin
  FMVCEngine := TMVCEngine.Create(Self);
	
  // Add Yours Controllers
  FMVCEngine.AddController(TYourController);
	
  // Add Security Middleware
  FMVCEngine.AddMiddleware(TMVCBasicAuthenticationMiddleware.Create(
    TMVCDefaultAuthenticationHandler.New
    .SetOnAuthentication(
		procedure(const AUserName, APassword: string;
		  AUserRoles: TList<string>; var IsValid: Boolean; 
		  const ASessionData: TDictionary<String, String>)
		begin
		  IsValid := AUserName.Equals('dmvc') and APassword.Equals('123');
		end
		)
    ));
end;  
```

In stand alone mode you can work with a context that supports multiple listeners servers:

```delphi
uses
  MVCFramework.Server,
  MVCFramework.Server.Impl;

var
  LServerListenerCtx: IMVCListenersContext;

begin
  LServerListenerCtx := TMVCListenersContext.Create;

  LServerListenerCtx.Add(TMVCListenerProperties.New
    .SetName('Listener1')
    .SetPort(6000)
    .SetMaxConnections(1024)
    .SetWebModuleClass(WebModuleClass1)
    );

  LServerListenerCtx.Add(TMVCListenerProperties.New
    .SetName('Listener2')
    .SetPort(7000)
    .SetMaxConnections(1024)
    .SetWebModuleClass(WebModuleClass2)
    );

  LServerListenerCtx.StartAll;
end;  
```

# RQL Introduction

Resource Query Language (RQL) is a query language designed for use in URIs with object style data structures. DMVCFramework supports RQL natively and the included MVCActiveRecord micro-framework, implement a large subset of the RQL specs. 

RQL can be thought as basically a set of nestable named operators which each have a set of arguments. RQL is designed to have an extremely simple, but extensible grammar that can be written in a URL friendly query string. A simple RQL query with a single operator that indicates a search for any resources with a property of "foo" that has value of 5 could be written:

```SPARQL
eq(foo,5)
```

A more complex filter can include an arbitrary number of chained functions

```SPARQL
or(and(eq(name,"daniele"),eq(surname,"teti")),and(eq(name,"peter"),eq(surname,"parker"));sort(+name)
```

Which is translated (details depends from the RDBMS) in the following SQL.

```sql
select 
	name, surname {other fields} 
from 
	people
where
  (name = "daniele" and surname = "teti") 
  	or 
  (name="peter" and surname = "parker")
order by
  name asc
```



### RQL as Implemented by DMVCFramework

RQL is designed for modern application development. It is built for the web, ready for NoSQL, and highly extensible with simple syntax. 

Here is a definition of the common operators as implemented in DMVCFramework' ActiveRecord:

```
eq(<property>,<value>) - Filters for objects where the specified property's value is equal to the provided value
lt(<property>,<value>) - Filters for objects where the specified property's value is less than the provided value
le(<property>,<value>) - Filters for objects where the specified property's value is less than or equal to the provided value
gt(<property>,<value>) - Filters for objects where the specified property's value is greater than the provided value
ge(<property>,<value>) - Filters for objects where the specified property's value is greater than or equal to the provided value
ne(<property>,<value>) - Filters for objects where the specified property's value is not equal to the provided value
and(<query>,<query>,...) - Applies all the given queries
or(<query>,<query>,...) - The union of the given queries
sort(<+|-><property) - Sorts by the given property in order specified by the prefix (+ for ascending, - for descending)
limit(count,start,maxCount) - Returns the given range of objects from the result set
contains(<property>,<value | expression>) - Filters for objects where the specified property's value is an array and the array contains any value that equals the provided value or satisfies the provided expression.
in(<property>,<array-of-values>) - Filters for objects where the specified property's value is in the provided array
out(<property>,<array-of-values>) - Filters for objects where the specified property's value is not in the provided array
```

**Not Yet Availables**

```
select(<property>,<property>,...) - Trims each object down to the set of properties defined in the arguments
values(<property>) - Returns an array of the given property value for each object
aggregate(<property|function>,...) - Aggregates the array, grouping by objects that are distinct for the provided properties, and then reduces the remaining other property values using the provided functions
distinct() - Returns a result set with duplicates removed
excludes(<property>,<value | expression>) - Filters for objects where the specified property's value is an array and the array does not contain any of value that equals the provided value or satisfies the provided expression.
rel(<relation name?>,<query>) - Applies the provided query against the linked data of the provided relation name.
sum(<property?>) - Finds the sum of every value in the array or if the property argument is provided, returns the sum of the value of property for every object in the array
mean(<property?>) - Finds the mean of every value in the array or if the property argument is provided, returns the mean of the value of property for every object in the array
max(<property?>) - Finds the maximum of every value in the array or if the property argument is provided, returns the maximum of the value of property for every object in the array
min(<property?>) - Finds the minimum of every value in the array or if the property argument is provided, returns the minimum of the value of property for every object in the array
recurse(<property?>) - Recursively searches, looking in children of the object as objects in arrays in the given property value
first() - Returns the first record of the query's result set
one() - Returns the first and only record of the query's result set, or produces an error if the query's result set has more or less than one record in it.
count() - Returns the count of the number of records in the query's result set
```
